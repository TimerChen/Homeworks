Problem Statement

A priority queue is a container adaptor that provides constant time lookup of the largest (by default) element, at the expense of logarithmic insertion and extraction. In our homework, you should implement a class that can provide some of the akin methods.

ATTENTION: This is an extended task for advanced students.

Specifically, your should fill the blanks in the following file:

priority_queue.hpp
And there are several files you may need to complete and debug your code:

utility.hpp
exceptions.hpp
data.zip
The name of the datasets and their corresponding ids are listed below:

one, 1000ms, 1GB

two, 1000ms, 1GB

three, 1000ms, 1GB

four, 1000ms, 1GB

five, 1000ms, 1GB

one.memcheck, 1000ms, 1GB

two.memcheck, 3000ms, 1GB

three.memcheck, 3000ms, 1GB

four.memcheck, 1000ms, 1GB

five.memcheck, 2000ms, 1GB

NOTICE: the data in folder [DATA] may be different from the data in folder [DATA].memcheck.
